name=Tree Layout
description=A classical layout algorithm

TreeLayout.area.name = Area
TreeLayout.area.desc = The graph size area, for example 1000 for 100 nodes.

TreeLayout.gravity.name = Gravity
TreeLayout.gravity.desc = This force attracts all nodes to the center to avoid dispersion of disconnected components.

TreeLayout.speed.name = Speed
TreeLayout.speed.desc = Value > 0 default 1 ; increase convergence speed at the price of a precision loss.
